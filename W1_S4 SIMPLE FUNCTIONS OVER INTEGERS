Let's define two functions working with integers:

1. multiple_of that takes two integer parameters, n and d, and determines whether n is a multiple of d. The function must return a boolean value. This function can be written without recursion. Look at the operators defined on integers in sequence 1.

2. integer_square_root that calculates the integer square root of a positive integer n, that is the largest integer r such that r * r <= n. Hint: you may use floating point arithmetic, but don't forget that you have to convert explicitely between float and int.

Answer:

let multiple_of n d = 
  if n mod d = 0 then true else false;;

let integer_square_root n = 
  int_of_float ( floor ( sqrt (float_of_int n)));;
