#+title: Week 1 Session 3: Integer Identifiers
Suppose that a variable x exists and is an integer. Define a variable x_power_8 that uses three multiplications to calculate x to the power of 8. The only function you are allowed to call is the (*) operator.
 - /Hint: use auxiliary variables./

The given prelude:
#+begin_src ocaml
let x = Random.int 9 + 1 (* not 0 *)
#+end_src
Answer:
#+begin_src ocaml
let x_power_8 =
  let y = x * x in
  let z = y * y in
  z * z
#+end_src
