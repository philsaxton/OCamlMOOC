#+title: Week 1 Session 4: Simple Functions Over Strings
Let's define two functions working with strings:
1. last_character that returns the last character of a string, assuming that the string argument is not empty.
2. string_of_bool that converts a boolean value to its string representation.

Answer:
#+begin_src ocaml
let last_character str =
  String.get str (String.length str - 1);;

let string_of_bool truth = 
  if truth = true then "true" else "false";; 
#+end_src
