In this exercise, you will improve the code shown in the course (and given in the template) for rotating arrays.

1. There is something perfectible with the code of rotate. 
Find what, and fix the function!.
2. Define rotate_by: 'a array -> int -> unit adding a parameter that allows to rotate by n positions. 
For instance, rotate_by [|1;2;3;4|] 3 should yield [|4;1;2;3|].

Answer:

let rotate a =
  let n = Array.length a in 
  if n = 0 then () else
    let v = a.(0) in
    for i = 0 to n-2 do
      a.(i) <- a.(i+1)
    done;
    a.(n-1)<-v;;

let rotate_by a n = 
  match n with 
    0 -> ()
  | n ->
      let l = (Array.length a) + n in 
      if n < 0 
      then 
        for count = 1 to l do
          rotate a
        done
      else
        for count = 1 to n do
          rotate a
        done;;
