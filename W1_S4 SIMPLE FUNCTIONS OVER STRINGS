Let's define two functions working with strings:

1. last_character that returns the last character of a string, assuming that the string argument is not empty;

2. string_of_bool that converts a boolean value to its string representation.

Answer:

let last_character str =
  String.get str (String.length str - 1);;

let string_of_bool truth = 
  if truth = true then "true" else "false";;
