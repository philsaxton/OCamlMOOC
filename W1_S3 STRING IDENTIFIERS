Suppose that a variable word exists and is a string.
Define a variable sentence that uses 5 string concatenations to create a string containing 9 times word, separated by commas (',').
This time, experiment with defining local let ... ins to store the partial results.

Answer:
let sentence =
  let x = word ^ "," in
  let x = x ^ x in
  let x = x ^ x in
  let x = x ^ x in x ^ word;;
