Suppose that a variable x exists and is an integer.
Define a variable x_power_8 that uses three multiplications to calculate x to the power of 8. The only function you are allowed to call is the (*) operator.
Hint: use auxiliary variables.

THE GIVEN PRELUDE:
let x = Random.int 9 + 1 (* not 0 *)

Answer:
let x = x * x;;
let x = x * x;;
let x_power_8 = x * x;;
